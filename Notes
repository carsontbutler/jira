commit: added to EditBoardColumnsForm, created DeleteColumnView endpoint

next time: 
6/28
-Delete button works but it deletes all tickets. Need to add a confirmation modal to confirm the user wants to delete. If it has tickets in it, list the number of tickets to the user.






-COMBINE ACTIVEBOARD AND ACTIVEBOARDDATA INTO 1. WHENEVER AN ORGANIZATION IS SELECTED, LOAD AND SET ALL BOARD DATA
-need to really figure out the New Board stuff (async/await? or what)
-create EditBoard endpoint, finish submitHandler for EditBoard
-finish and test CreateBoard modal/form
-figure out the props.ticket.assignee thing on Ticket component (shows up when switching btwn boards)

Need to test more: Create Ticket form

**issues**
-Logging out needs to clear all saved data. currently isn't
-Refresh tokens are only refreshing once. Then the next one is giving unauthorized message. but the refresh token still works in postman.
-Reduce the access token time once the above is fixed
-Switching from gmail board to yahoo board sometimes causes error (with props.ticket?)
-NEED TO CHANGE COLUMN FIELD ON TICKET MODEL TO BE REQUIRED = TRUE

**Frontend**
<NAV>
-Make NEW board button work, add new board page
<LoginForm>
-Center it vertically
<Function>
-store activeOrganization in localStorage

**Backend**
-add ticket number to Ticket model

debt: axios interceptor, refresh token, change access token duration
